This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and otherwise handle your information when you use our Apps and related services.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Information You Provide Directly
- **Account Information:** When creating accounts in our Apps, we may collect your name, email, username, and profile information.
- **App-Specific Data:** Depending on which App you use, we collect data relevant to its function (e.g., availability schedules in FriendLy, tasks in Tempo, contacts in Nurture, etc.).
- **Communications:** Messages, notes, or feedback you submit to us or within the Apps.
- **User-Generated Content:** Any content you create while using our Apps.

- **Cookies and Similar Technologies:** We may use cookies, local storage, or similar tracking technologies to enhance user experience and remember preferences.

### 1.3 Local-First Data
Our Apps are designed with **local-first architecture**, meaning most of your data is stored locally on your device. This is a core privacy feature of our design. Data is only synchronized to our servers when you explicitly choose to sync or use cloud features.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use collected information to:
- **Provide and Improve Services:** Deliver the Apps' functionality and develop new features.

- **Legal Compliance:** Comply with applicable laws, regulations, and legal processes.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

### 3.1 We Do NOT Sell Your Data
We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.

### 3.2 When We Share Information
- **Service Providers:** We may share information with third-party service providers who assist us in operating the Apps (e.g., hosting providers, analytics services). These providers are bound by confidentiality agreements.
- **Legal Obligations:** We may disclose information when required by law, court order, or government request.
- **Business Transfers:** In the event of merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.
- **Consent:** We share information with your explicit consent.

### 3.3 App-Specific Sharing
- **FriendLy:** You control whether your availability and hangout information is shared publicly or visible only to your network.
- **Manifest:** Connection preferences and discovery data remain private unless you explicitly share your profile.
- **Other Apps:** Sharing is opt-in and controlled through App settings.

## 4. Data Retention

- **Active Accounts:** We retain your account data while your account is active.
- **Inactive Accounts:** After account deletion or 12 months of inactivity, we may delete your data unless legally required to retain it.
- **Local-First Data:** Data stored locally on your device remains under your control and is not affected by our retention policies.
- **Backup and Archives:** We may retain archived copies of data for up to 90 days after deletion for backup purposes.

## 5. Data Security

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information:
- **Encryption:** Data in transit is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS protocols.
- **Local Storage Security:** Local-first data on your device is protected by your device's security settings.
- **Access Controls:** Only authorized personnel have access to personal data.
- **Regular Audits:** We conduct regular security reviews and updates.

**Important:** No security system is impenetrable. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 6. Your Rights and Choices

You have the right to access your personal data and, in many jurisdictions, request a portable copy of your data.

### 6.5 Regional Rights
- **GDPR (EU/UK):** If you're in the EU or UK, you have the right to access, correct, delete, and port your data, plus the right to object to processing.
- **CCPA (California):** California residents have the right to know, delete, and opt-out of the sale of personal information (which we don't do).
- **Other Jurisdictions:** We comply with applicable regional privacy laws.

## 7. Third-Party Links and Services

The Apps may contain links to third-party websites and services. We are not responsible for their privacy practices. Please review their privacy policies before using their services.
