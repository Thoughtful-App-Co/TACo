# CODEOWNERS
#
# This file defines who owns different parts of the codebase.
# Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull request
# that modifies code that they own.
#
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# The pattern format follows the same rules as .gitignore files.
# The last matching pattern takes the most precedence.
#
# More information:
